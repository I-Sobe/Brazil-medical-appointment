# Investigate a Dataset
## by Nwangene Sobe-Olisa
### a Udacity-ALX Intro to Data Analysis Project

## Dataset (noshowappointment.csv)
This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patients are included in each row.
> ScheduledDay tells us on what day the patient set up their
appointment.
> Neighborhood indicates the location of the hospital.
> Scholarship indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program [Bolsa Familia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolsa_Fam%C3%ADlia).
> Be careful about the encoding of the last column: it says ‘No’ if the patient showed up to  their appointment, and ‘Yes’ if they did not show up.
