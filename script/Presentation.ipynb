    "From the analysis done through the questions answered, it shows the following:\n",
    "a) Of the numerous independent variables collected, only:\n",
    "* `Gender`   *`Age`      * `Diabetes`      * `Hypertension`    * `Handicap`    *`Neighborhoods(2,5,7,8)`\n",
    "* `scheduled_month`     *`appointment_month`         *` scheduled_day `             * `appointment_day` has a postive effect on the dependent variable(show)\n",
    "\n",
    "b) For the Gender variable, Males are slightly more likely to show up than females irrespective of their health status(diabetics, hypertensive or handicap). We noticed a sharp jump when looking at patients with type 2 handicap(more than the normal difference)\n",
    "\n",
    "c) As regrads to age, there's a general progression in the likely to keep to an appointment as we moved from Gen_z to bloomers, although there was a dip with the milennials.\n",
    "\n",
    "d) Of all the medical history recorded, alcoholism are the least likely to show up while the hypertensive are the most likely. Diabetics and handicapped came in second and third respectively.With the same noticed low turn up with patients on type 2 handicap.\n",
    "\n",
    "e) Scholarship and SMS isn't a factor in determining patients show up, as patients without government funding and didn't receive a notification where more likely to show up.\n",
    "\n",
    "f) Patients in Neighborhoods 2,5,7,8 has a higher show up rate than other neighborhoods(which actual showed a decline in show rate), with [neighborhood 2](####neighborhoods) having the highest. Furthermore, it's observed that debatics in neighborhood 2 are less likely to show up than diabetics in other 3 neighborhoods (5,7,8), so the high show up for patients in neighborhood 2 doesn't include the diabetics amongst them."
